# Mental Health & Cardiovascular Disease (BRFSS 2020)

This project analyzes how psychological, behavioral, and demographic factors
are associated with cardiovascular disease using the 2020 BRFSS dataset.

The notebook includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Statistical tests (Chi-square, Wilcoxon, Effect Size)
- Three logistic regression models:
  1) Psychological factors  
  2) + Behavioral factors  
  3) + Sociodemographic factors (full model)
     
Key finding:  
Mental health indicators (`MentalBadDays`, `DepressionDiag`) remain significant predictors of CVD
even after adjusting for other variables.

This project reflects my interest in health-related data analysis and statistical modeling.
